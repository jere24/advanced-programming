# Group Project for the class "Programming with Advanced Computer Languages"
Johannes Cordier and Jeremia Stalder

Our goal for this group project was twofold: First, we wanted to get to know Python and how to use it for a real world project. Second, we wanted to learn new machine learning techniques and directly apply them.
