# Group Project for the class "Programming with Advanced Computer Languages"
_**Johannes Cordier and Jeremia Stalder**_

Our goal for this group project was twofold: First, we wanted to get to know Python and how to use it for a real world project. Second, we wanted to learn new machine learning techniques and directly apply them.

TODO quick description of what we did in our project

## Data
> All data handling can be found in the file [data.ipynb](https://github.com/jere24/advanced-programming/blob/master/data_cleaning.ipynb)


## Random forest
> Everything related to the random forest can be found in the file [RandomForest function.ipynb](https://github.com/jere24/advanced-programming/blob/master/RandomForest%20function.ipynb)

## Neural network
> Everything related to the random forest can be found in the file [NeuralNet.ipynb]()

## Comparison
> Everything related to the random forest can be found in the file [comparison.ipynb]()
TODO How do the two methods compare? Which one is better?
